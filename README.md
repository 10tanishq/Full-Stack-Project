# Full Stack Project

This project is a full stack application featuring two different UIs (`FinalUI` and `project`) that utilize the same backend (`swigyMain`). The backend is built using the Spring Boot framework and connects to a MySQL database named `swigy1`. The backend provides REST APIs for CRUD operations, which are consumed by both UIs.

## Features
- **Two Distinct UIs:** 
  - `project`: A form-based page to enter, display, and delete details.
  - `FinalUI`: A dynamic product listing page with cart functionality.
- **Backend:**
  - Developed with Spring Boot.
  - CRUD operations implemented using REST APIs.
  - MySQL database integration.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Spring Boot
- Database: MySQL (`swigy1`)

## How to Run
1. Set up MySQL database with the name `swigy1`.
2. Run the Spring Boot application (`swigyMain`).
3. Open `project` or `FinalUI` in a web browser to interact with the respective UIs.
